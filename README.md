# Muse2pokecrystal
This is merely a script that takes musicxml and converts it to music code for pokecrystal. Musicxml is exported by programs such as musescore.

The script expects four different channels. Two square sound channels, one wave channel (of some sort (sine/saw)), and a drumset channel.
