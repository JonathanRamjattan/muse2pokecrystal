# Muse2pokecrystal
A script that takes MusicXML and converts it to music code for pokecrystal.
MusicXML is exported by programs such as [Musescore](https://musescore.org) and Finale Notepad.

The script expects at least three different channels: two square sound channels and one wave channel of some sort (sine/saw).
The fourth drumset channel is optional.
