# Starting the Process in Musescore

So to start off, you need to start up musescore and create a new score. It's pretty simple, just start an empty score and pick your instruments.

### Channels
The script is very strict about having four channels right now, but channel 4 could be left empty.
I recommend picking channels 1 and 2 as square instruments, those are under the electronic instuments, because those are the first two channels on a Gameboy.
The next, I recommend as a sine wave or saw wave channel for the third channel.
There is only one drumset under percussion for channel 4.

### Writing your score
Musescore has an interactive tour/tutorial that you can follow to learn to use it, very handy.
It'll show you how to enter notes on the score and how to make minor changes to it.

If you have music material you are sourcing, you may need to make some creative changes to make it work for pokecrystal.
You cannot have chords in pokecrystal, so you need to make doubly sure that you only have one note at a time per channel.
Because of the way this works, you can still make chords, but using multiple channels.

### Importing Midis
You can import midis into muscore, I'm not sure how to edit them though or cut out the channels, I'm sure there is a way, though.

### Saving your MusicXML
You can save the project in musescore's format, but I recommend just exporting as musicxml from the file menu > export.
You can still open the xml in musescore for later editing, that way you leave less artifacts after, the musicxml won't be edited by the script, just read.
